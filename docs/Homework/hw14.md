## Problems

### Problem 1: Character

???+ question "Step 1: Documentation"
    Read Unreal's [documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/creating-a-metahuman-in-metahuman-creator) on creating Metahumans. Please not that you must be workin in Unreal Engine 5 or above.

???+ question "Step 2: Create Character"
    If you are on Windows, please install the [MetaHuman Plugin](https://www.fab.com/listings/055a6486-ad17-4590-aa1e-261d47f7f041) from the Marketplace. Currently, the MetaHuman Plugin does not work on Linux and MacOS (unless I am mistaken).

    If you are unable to access the MetaHuman Plugin, you may work with the [MetaHuman Creator](https://www.epicgames.com/id/login?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmetahuman.unrealengine.com%2Feos-login-redirect&scope=basic_profile&client_id=xyza7891OORp4qeFMsqG8MGwJLsun9Tb) platform.

    Both MetaHuman Plugin and MetaHuman Creator allow you to design your own character; however, in my experience, MetaHuman Creator seemed to be more laggy.
