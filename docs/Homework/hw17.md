## Game AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) in games gives space for generative response and intelligent behavior. In game AI, this is common and integral part of non-playable characters (NPCs). The idea of AI opponents that responds depending on the play'er input is popular. However, AI is also used in areas that are not always visible to the player.

Game AI encompasses a broad set of algorithms that mimic intelligence. It can be argued that the video game AI is not true intelligence, but is instead, a set of computer programs that use sorting and matching algorithms to create the illusion of intelligent behavior.

## Search Algorithms

## A* Pathfinding Algorithm
Lets take a look at how and why the A* algorithm works.

Imagine a grid of nodes where we want to move from node A to node B. The A* search algorithm finds the shortest path from begin node to endpoint.

This is executed by examining all the surrounding nodes to find and determine each heuristic.
