# Lab 0: Set Up

In our next two class sessions, we will be learning Godot and Unreal Engine with the Perforce as our primary source control tool. 

## Perforce
Perforce is known for its roots with version control. However, Perforce as a whole does much more than create version control tools. Perforce is ideal for large files and binaries that have a lot of assets. Perforce also allows users to lock certain files which is helpful in collaborating on projects.
