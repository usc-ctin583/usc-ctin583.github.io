Unity allows developers to build games for a variety of platforms. Exporting your game to some platform is an important part of game development, a task that every game developer will have to do at least once during their career! To test your projects, create a build. To release your game to the public, create development builds by checking the `Development Builds` box.

**Important notes:**

* Install optional modules in Unity Hub
* Easily switch between different platforms but code may look different for each platform
* Must accomodate designing for different platforms and adjust the input system to reflect so
* Create a new folder for your builds. Do not push these buils to GitHub and Perforce
* Sometimes the game within your editor will not look and feel the same as your built game
* It is not recommended to rename the folder name that was automatically generated for you. It might break things. If you want to change the name, make a whole new and separate build

## Rendering Quality
For each device or platform you build to, it is important to consider the quality and the rendering settings of the game. Feel free to adjust and set a certain quality level for different platforms and levels within the game. This will take some experimentation to get to a setting that works best for your game. Edit the settings under `Edit/Project Settings/Quality`.

## Player Settings
You may also have different build settings for each player. Under `Edit/Project Settings/Player`, you may modify player icons, cursors, and names. You can also modify the splash screen animation!
