## üìô Introduction

Fluency in the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äôs‚Äù through game design is important. But also the ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù that situate games as a cultural activity is essential as a contributor in the future of gaming but also to your career. The importance of innovation, research 

Take this final project as an opportunity to grow your soft skills of why you love and chose to learn game development. Find something you want to dive into that will challenge the state of the art and enable you to advance through your career. Here is the opportunity to create an experience that excites you with any game engine of your choice in addition to the mentorship of your instructors. Carefully consider what your needs are and what you are trying to accomplish when deciding to develop with Unreal, Godot, or Unity. 

**By the end of this project you will:**

* Participate in code reviews with [Perforce]()
* Create UI to bring your project together with [UI Toolkit]()
* Master UXML, USS, C# and/or HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Collaborate and share builds with [GitHub repositories]()
* Pair programming in [Visual Studio Code]()
* Create an software experience that you are proud of - game, AR/VR experience, app, website, etc.
* Gain experience in what goes into publishing your projects and experiences
* Understand why you picked your selected platform and the ins and outs of it
* Work with your platform's respective SDKs 
* Have expertise and background knowledge in the hardware you are publishing to
* Have a published a game!

## üßê Questions

### Game Experience

* What is a digital and software experience that you find interesting? Is there anything you've always wanted to try making? Think of an idea that gets you excited and let's try to create it with Unity, Unreal, or Godot! 

* Art has a responsibility to contribute cultural and humanist dimensions to our definition of the future. How does the intersection of art and technology move us from ephemeral performance to sustainable innovation? Ideate on ideas for a project and then write about it in your research paper.

* How does your experience critically explore its social, cultural, and affective impact?

* What is your experience's potential use case in the releam of emerging digital technologies? How does it impact users and citizens? Does your experience confront any major challenges of our time?

### Game Design

* Can I make a cozy, relaxing roguelike?

* What happens if the player‚Äôs ability regresses as the game progresses?

* Can I make a game where the mechanic is trying to understand an alien language?

* What happens if the player needs to solve violent problems nonviolently?

* What happens if you combine environment destruction gameplay with a cooking game?

* Can I make a game where the player is neither the protagonist nor the antagonist?

* Can I create the game version of the phrase ‚Äúwrong answers only‚Äù?

* What actions should the player take?


## üëæ The Game

The goal of your final project for this class is twofold:

- [x] Put into practice the prototyping skills you have learned over the past 12 weeks. You are capable of expressing your design ideas in software, so let‚Äôs come up with some interesting design ideas and express them!
- [x] Start thinking about ‚Äúdesign problems,‚Äù that is, the kinds of questions you can answer through prototyping. These are often questions of the form ‚ÄúWhat happens if?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù

Pick the platform you want to build for and publish to intentionally. Tailor your experience to the platform you selected. In project 2, I would like you to try publishing your experience or game and experiment with how you can take it to market. Consider the most natural inputs for your experience. Please note that many of these platforms do require a fee; however, you are welcome to use the instructor's account at no additional cost.

???+ abstract "Short Art Papers"

    How do we come to terms with contemporary media art culture that consists of varied practices ranging from craft to design to installation, software, hardware, choreography, mixed-media, and more? What current trajectories exist now that algorithmic processes, decades in the making, have finally advanced so much that they can generate usable code, graphics, and sounds from spoken or written prompts? What new methods or questions are needed as we leave visual space and return to acoustic space where orality, ambience, and overlapping and touchless media reign? How do we define and navigate the intersectional suprastructure that allows certain media practices to flourish while others are starved or co-opted? How do we process the entirety of this networked sphere of media intercourse under real planetary constraints? The SIGGRAPH Art Papers track is the premier place to publish critical findings within these diverse fields of art practices where they converge on screen, through interactive methods, within digital, mechanical, or biological interfaces. 
    - [SIGGRAPH 2024, Art Papers](https://s2024.siggraph.org/program/art-papers/)

    Short Art Papers are limited to 2,500-words and; 10 pages (including all references, tables, figures and figure captions. Papers should be proofed and completely anonymized.

    **Necessary information to include:**

    - [x] **Title of Short Paper:**
    - [x] **Abstract:** A 250-word (maximum) abstract summarizing the key points of the paper. Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.
    - [x] **Why It Matters:** A 100 word (maximum) abstract explaining why your artwork is important for the whole SIGGRAPH community, in a large sense, from raising critical issues to opening perspectives or generating solutions. Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.

## ü¶Ñ Support

Ask for help! Don't be afraid to reach out to us and ask for help. Work together with your classmates and schedule office hours with the instructors whenever you need help and support.

!!! question "Do I need to learn all the different languages for each platform? What if I don't know Swift/Kotlin/Javascript/C++/Java ?"

    Don't worry! You don't need to know all the languages and don't need to know everything about each language. You will work a little bit in those languages to make minor tweaks. Plus, the instructors are here to help you!

!!! question "A research paper usually takes a lot of work. Are we really going to write out a full research paper ?"

    It will be a research paper but it will be scaled down and shortened! We will be learning how to style write a professional paper that can be submitted for conferences in the future. 

!!! question "What if they don't approve the game I submitted ?"

    That is okay! Ideally, you will have a published app on the platform of your choice. But if it doesn't work out, we will at least publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

!!! question "Why do we need to learn how to pair program and participate in code reviews ?"

    Game development is a collaborative effort so it is important to learn how to collaborate on designs and code. There are many great tools that will support collaboration within Visual Studio Code, Perforce, GitHub, and Unity.

!!! question "What if I don't want to publish my game ?"

    It is required to publish your game for project 2. Going through the process of sharing and putting up your game is an important part of the development experience. You will learn A LOT. At minimum, you should be publish your game to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/).
