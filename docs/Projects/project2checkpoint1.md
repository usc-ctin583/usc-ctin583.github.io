What is pair programming? Pair programming is an approach in which two developers program together with continuous collaboration on the same technical task. Working together can improve communication amongst others who are working on the project and provide opportunities for live and continuous code reviews. A huge plus to pair programming is that it can make completing a task much more fun while learning from one another. 

For this checkpoint, please open one Perforce depot project with at least one classmate. Our goal is to try pair programming techniques within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v).

## ü§ñ Perforce
With more and more teams working remotely, and more companies hiring employees in different geographic regions, code collaboration tools are important for improving the efficiency of remote teamwork. They enable clearer communication between team members, and many offer features that support teamwork in real-time. 

Code collaboration tools improve code quality (and therefore quality of the final product) in a number of ways, depending on the type of tool in question. Version control maintains a full history of every iteration of your code, allowing you to easily roll back to a previous version or identify exactly where an issue originated. Code review tools help catch bugs (and catch them early), improve code readability, and help maintain best practices. ([Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/solutions/developer-collaboration))

!!! note "Perforce Streams"

    [Perforce Streams](https://www.perforce.com/video-tutorials/vcs/streams-overview) are how branching and merging are performed within Helix Core. [Streams](https://www.perforce.com/video-tutorials/vcs/streams-overview) bring built-in intelligence to managing how changes flow from one branch or codeline to another. This makes it more convenient for developers by helping team members visualize the bigger picture. [Perforce Steams](https://www.perforce.com/video-tutorials/vcs/streams-overview) also helps bypass tedious configuration details so that teams can start working right away. 

    [Streams](https://www.perforce.com/video-tutorials/vcs/streams-overview) are similar to channels that help you and your team make sure each change gets to the right place in the correct manner. A unique feature of P4V is the [Stream Graph](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4v/Content/P4V/streams.graph.html). The Stream Graph shows your project's codelines and branches, quickly creating and easily flows of changes between workflows. It also helps with orienting the project with its hierarchy and detailed connections between streams.
