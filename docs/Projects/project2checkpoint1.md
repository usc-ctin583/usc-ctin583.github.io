What is pair programming? Pair programming is an approach in which two developers program together with continuous collaboration on the same technical task. Working together can improve communication amongst others who are working on the project and provide opportunities for live and continuous code reviews. A huge plus to pair programming is that it can make completing a task much more fun while learning from one another. 

For this checkpoint, please open one Perforce depot project with at least one classmate. Our goal is to try pair programming techniques within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v).
