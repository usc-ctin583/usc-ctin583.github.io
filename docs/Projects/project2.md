## üìô Introduction

Fluency in the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äôs‚Äù through game design is important. But also the ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù that situate games as a cultural activity is essential as a contributor in the future of gaming but also to your career. The importance of innovation, research 

Take this final project as an opportunity to grow your soft skills of why you love and chose to learn game development. Find something you want to dive into that will challenge the state of the art and enable you to advance through your career. Here is the opportunity to create an experience that excites you with any game engine of your choice in addition to the mentorship of your instructors. Carefully consider what your needs are and what you are trying to accomplish when deciding to develop with Unreal, Godot, or Unity. 

**By the end of this project you will:**

* Participate in code reviews with [Perforce]()
* Create UI to bring your project together with [UI Toolkit]()
* Master UXML, USS, C# and/or HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Collaborate and share builds with [GitHub repositories]()
* Pair programming in [Visual Studio Code]()
* Create an software experience that you are proud of - game, AR/VR experience, app, website, etc.
* Gain experience in what goes into publishing your projects and experiences
* Understand why you picked your selected platform and the ins and outs of it
* Work with your platform's respective SDKs 
* Have expertise and background knowledge in the hardware you are publishing to
* Have a published a game!

## üßê Questions

* What is a digital and software experience that you find interesting? Is there anything you've always wanted to try making? Think of an idea that gets you excited and let's try to create it with Unity, Unreal, or Godot! 

* Art has a responsibility to contribute cultural and humanist dimensions to our definition of the future. How does the intersection of art and technology move us from ephemeral performance to sustainable innovation? Ideate on ideas for a project and then write about it in your research paper.

* How does your experience critically explore its social, cultural, and affective impact?

* What is your experience's potential use case in the releam of emerging digital technologies? How does it impact users and citizens? Does your experience confront any major challenges of our time?

## üëæ The Game

Pick the platform you want to build for and publish to intentionally. Tailor your experience to the platform you selected. In project 2, I would like you to try publishing your experience or game and experiment with how you can take it to market. Consider the most natural inputs for your experience. Please note that many of these platforms do require a fee; however, you are welcome to use the instructor's account at no additional cost.
