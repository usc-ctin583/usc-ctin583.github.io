* Art has a responsibility to contribute cultural and humanist dimensions to our definition of the future. How does the intersection of art and technology move us from ephemeral performance to sustainable innovation? Ideate on ideas for a project and then write about it in your research paper.

* How does your experience critically explore its social, cultural, and affective impact?

* What is your experience's potential use case in the releam of emerging digital technologies? How does it impact users and citizens? Does your experience confront any major challenges of our time?

## üëæ The Game

Pick the platform you want to build for and publish to intentionally. Tailor your experience to the platform you selected.
