## üìô Introduction

Fluency in the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äôs‚Äù through game design is important. But also the ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù that situate games as a cultural activity is essential as a contributor in the future of gaming but also to your career. The importance of innovation, research 

Take this final project as an opportunity to grow your soft skills of why you love and chose to learn game development. Find something you want to dive into that will challenge the state of the art and enable you to advance through your career. Here is the opportunity to create an experience that excites you with any game engine of your choice in addition to the mentorship of your instructors. Carefully consider what your needs are and what you are trying to accomplish when deciding to develop with Unreal, Godot, or Unity. 

**Questions to consider:**

* What is a digital and software experience that you find interesting? Is there anything you've always wanted to try making? Think of an idea that gets you excited and let's try to create it with Unity, Unreal, or Godot! 

* Art has a responsibility to contribute cultural and humanist dimensions to our definition of the future. How does the intersection of art and technology move us from ephemeral performance to sustainable innovation? Ideate on ideas for a project and then write about it in your research paper.

* How does your experience critically explore its social, cultural, and affective impact?

* What is your experience's potential use case in the releam of emerging digital technologies? How does it impact users and citizens? Does your experience confront any major challenges of our time?
