## üìô Introduction
The intent of this project is to build, run, and publish a 3D Unity game that tackles a social justice issue. You will be implementing your own version of a WebGL single-player video game with multiple levels. Please feel free to start with the 3D Unity project we have been working on in class as a starting point. I recommend making a copy of the class project to avoid confusing our class project from your project 1. Make sure the game is created with the Universal Render Pipeline ([URP](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline)) and supports [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v) integration.

**By the end of Project 1, you will:** 

* Gain an understanding of the usage of Unity Engine - AI ([NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMesh.html)), [Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@3.0/manual/index.html), and [Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsSection.html)
* Program player movement and collisions with [Transform.Translate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html) and [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)
* Understand the unique qualities and features that are important in designing and playing browser-based games
* Have experience designing, building, and publishing 3D Unity games for [WebGL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html)
* Collaborate and share projects via Perforce
* Share and receive feedback on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) and other online platforms
* Have a final product that you can add to your portfolio
* Learn how to build interactive and immersive websites. See some examples on [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/unity/)


!!! warning "Policy on Collaboration and Cheating"
    For this project, you must work alone! Please carefully read the [Policy on Collaboration and Cheating]() to see what this means exactly. In particular, do not look for solutions online, use game templates, and generate code with AI such as ChatGPT. 



## üëæ The Game
Select a cause, set of values, or mission you care about. Through a 3D Unity URP game, advocate for that community through storytelling. Can you use your game to challenge beliefs, find purpose, uplift others, and spread compassion? In what form will that take? 

**Some potential topics:**

* Animal rights
* Accessibility
* Mental Health
* Environmental justice
* Sustainability

## üé¨ Getting Started


## üéüÔ∏è Requirements
* Unity 3D URP
* Published as a WebGL build on a website

## üßê Questions
* Who is the video game made for?
* What are the takeaway lessons players will learn from your game?
* What is the moral message of your game?
