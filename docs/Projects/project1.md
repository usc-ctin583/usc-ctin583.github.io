# ‚ù§Ô∏è Project 1: Advocacy

![Image title](../Projects/helpothers.jpg)

## üìô Introduction
The intent of this project is to build, run, and publish a 3D Unity game that tackles a social justice issue. You will be implementing your own version of a WebGL single-player video game with multiple levels. Please feel free to start with the 3D Unity project we have been working on in class as a starting point. Make sure the game is in Unity URP and supports Perforce integration.

**By the end of Project 1, you will:** 

* Gain an understanding of the usage of Unity AI, Cinemachine, and Physics
* Program player movement and collisions with transform and rigidbody
* Understand the unique qualities and features that are important in designing and playing browser-based games
* Have experience designing, building, and publishing 3D Unity games for WebGL
* Collaborate and share projects via Perforce
* Share and receive feedback on itch.io and other online platforms
* Have a final product that you can add to your portfolio
* Learn how to build interactive and immersive websites

!!! warning "Policy on Collaboration and Cheating"
    For this project, you must work alone! Please carefully read the Policy on Collaboration and Cheating to see what this means exactly. In particular, do not look for solutions online and use ChatGPT.


Select a cause, set of values, or mission you care about. Through a 3D Unity URP game, advocate for that community through storytelling. Can you use your game to challenge beliefs, find purpose, uplift others, and spread compassion? In what form will that take? 

Some potential topics:
* Animal rights
* Accessibility
* Mental Health
* Environmental justice
* Sustainability


## üéüÔ∏è Requirements
* Unity 3D URP
* Published as a WebGL build on a website
* Playable (Single player)
* Use assets and sound effects 
* Publish to [itch.io](https://itch.io/)

## üßê Questions
* Who is the video game made for?
* What are the takeaway lessons players will learn from your game?
* What is the moral message of your game?
