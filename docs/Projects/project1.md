## üìô Introduction
The intent of this project is to build, run, and publish a 3D Unity game that tackles a social justice issue. You will be implementing your own version of a WebGL single-player video game with multiple levels. Please feel free to start with the 3D Unity project we have been working on in class as a starting point. I recommend making a copy of the class project to avoid confusing our class project from your project 1. Make sure the game is created with the Universal Render Pipeline ([URP](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline)) and supports [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v) integration.

**By the end of Project 1, you will:** 

* Gain an understanding of the usage of Unity Engine - AI ([NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMesh.html)), [Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@3.0/manual/index.html), and [Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsSection.html)
* Program player movement and collisions with [Transform.Translate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html) and [Rigidbody](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html)
* Understand the unique qualities and features that are important in designing and playing browser-based games
* Have experience designing, building, and publishing 3D Unity games for [WebGL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html)
* Collaborate and share projects via Perforce
* Share and receive feedback on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) and other online platforms
* Have a final product that you can add to your portfolio
* Build a browser-based game with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and WebGL
* Experiment with Unity‚Äôs new [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html)
* Learn how to build interactive and immersive websites. See some examples on [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/unity/)



!!! warning "Policy on Collaboration and Cheating"
    For this project, you must work alone! Please carefully read the [Policy on Collaboration and Cheating]() to see what this means exactly. In particular, do not look for solutions online, use game templates, and generate code with AI such as ChatGPT. 



## üëæ The Game
Games have the power to reach, engage, and educate the public. No matter where we end up in life, sharing our knowledge, having and finding purpose, and inspiring others through our works are important in building a more equitable and sustainable world. Select a cause, set of values, or mission you care about and come up with an idea for a game that achieves meaningful social change. Pick something that matters to you and promote the cause and ideas through your game. Advocacy can take many forms such as storytelling, gameplay, and narrative mechanics that inspire players to take action. I challenge you to use your skills and creativity to create a short, fun, and complete game that challenges beliefs, investigates one‚Äôs purpose, uplifts others, and spreads compassion. 

**Some potential topics:**

* Animal rights
* Accessibility
* Mental Health
* Environmental justice
* Sustainability
