It is time to get feedback on your art research paper! Please give your classmates feedback on Google docs via comments. 

The term "critique" in a design context has historically referred to the process of exercising a critical examination on a proposed work, and making a systematic judgment of it. In design school, this format has long been an important mechanism for evaluating student work, for offering constructive feedback, and for celebrating the hard-won successes of design education. Through this Project 2 checkpoint, this is precisely the sort of critique we aim to provide.

Design critiques holds more than this instructional utility; they are also one of the primary sites in design for the production of new knowledge and value. The event of a design
critique brings together a range of disciplinary stakeholders: students and instructors, designers and specialists, academics and practitioners, and faculty from across subject areas. Through this critique let's create a pluralistic space where ideas are continually challenged, where new approaches are tested, and values are advocated for.

**Please consider the following as you critique your classmate's work:**

- [x] **Narrative:** how well does the narrative of the interview connect with the game theyh created?
- [x] **Engineering:** how well informed are the writer's implementation decisions?
- [x] **Replicability:** how detailed and readable is their reporting, such that another person could replicate their outcomes?
- [x] **Scope:** is the game concept both novel and achievable within the timeframe of the class?
- [x] **Completeness:** the report includes all required elements, as detailed in the Overleaf template.
